# pageref-pdf-links

demonstrates a problem with pageref links in PDF generated by pdflatex.

The link on page 2 to page 3 in the PDF document says '3', however the link leads to page 1.

The [solution](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/193380/hyperref-pageref-links-point-to-first-page) is to introduce new command
```tex
\newcommand{\hlabel}{\phantomsection\label}
```
and use it instead of **all** the `\label` commands.
